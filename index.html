I specialise and work in the <b>.NET technology stack</b> since its first beta release.<br/>  
I strive to understand the business use case before discussing a possible solution.  <br/>
In the last 6 years I have worked as <b>Head of Development</b> and <b>Team Leader</b> managing up to 2 teams with 15 team members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I worked with Hannes over 3 years while he managed our development team. <br/>
He always kept the pragamtic eye on team results while motivating and stimulating each individual team member and fostering team spirit. 
While negotiating requirements and contracts our team would fulfill he did a great job balancing team challenge and realism which was very helpful for our customers as well as the team. </br>
Considering the diversity of people he was involved with internally and externally, I am convinced he is a great lead in any environment.
